;************************
;TO DO LIST:
; -Move down at spouts?
; -Make Walley infront or behind waves depending on posiiton
; ->Jake: this *may* be possible, I would have to separate the spout from the tile and draw the waves and spouts at different times.
;   for now I have just put walley in front of everything-kelly
; -Win/Lose animations
; ->I'm going to try to add these after you reach the rainbow and before advancing to the next stage-kelly
; -Support WASD for up down side to side
; -> since I got the win when you reach the rainbow done, we can remove the w and s test for the win/loss. It was just for ease of testing.
; -Score calc based on time and lives
; -High Score added to Splash-screen
; -Sounds
